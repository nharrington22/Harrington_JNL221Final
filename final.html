			<h2> The Philadelphia Eagles, Crime Stoppers? Or Crime Bringers?</h2>
			<h4> Well known for their rowydiness, do Eagles fans tend to be more crime oriented or less after a win? And what can the Philadelphia PD do about it?<br>By Nate Harrington </h4>

			<h3>Why Investigate the Philadelphia Eagles?</h3>
						<p>The Philadelphia Eagles are more than just a sports team for the city. The fans are raucous, mean-spirited, but passionate for their home American Football team. When the Eagles win, they cheer, when they lose, they boo, and fight everyone all the time. This has been a trend for a while, with the old Veterans Stadium even having a jail after a fan shot “a smuggled flare gun” across the field. This in-house jail had a judge, the controversial Seamus McCaffery, and a holding cell for those too rowdy for the stadium seats. The jail was well warranted as Eagles fans have thrown snowballs (which had batteries and ice chunks in them) at Santa, rioted in the streets after winning the Super Bowl, and many more incidents. But does a higher win rate for the Philadelphia Eagles correlate with a lower crime rate? Or does the excitement of the Eagles win give more reason for crime to be perpetrated? <br><br>
			Looking at the arrest numbers for the city of Philadelphia (as reported by the Philadelphia Police department here), we can add in when Eagles were winning or losing in the year. During the time frame of December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, the Eagles spent 99 days winning – the definition a day of that category is the day the Eagles had that result and the following week – 29 days losing, 7 days on bye, and 231 days in the offseason.

			<h3>What the Data Says</h3>
			<p>The Eagles won a lot in 2022, finishing with the best record in the league and later (in 2023) making the Super Bowl, but did that deter crime?</p>

				According to the analysis of the data, crimes per day increases during the weeks were Eagles win. Not only do Eagle’s wins correlate with higher crime rate, during the weeks where the Eagles win, there is more crime per day than any other category of Eagles outcome. During Eagle’s winning week, there were roughly 431 arrests per day compared to 418.5 crimes per day over the course of the year for a percent increase of 3-percent. Comparing the winning weeks to the offseason weeks, there is still a percent increase of 2.75-percent.<br><br>
				Focusing in on the specific day of an Eagle’s win we can see the breakdown of how that day’s win affects the proportion of crime during the day. The data shows that during the hours of 4 pm (the earliest time an Eagles game would end) to 4 am the following day, there is a percent decrease of 7.2 percent. This suggests that the Eagles win, or at the very least the game itself, correlates to a lower crime rate after the game occurs. But a study by Daniel Rees and Kevin Schnepel finds that “results suggest that the host community registers sharp increases in assaults on game days. In addition, there is evidence that vandalism, arrests for disorderly conduct and alcohol-related arrests increase on game days,” (<a href  = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/1527002508327389" target = "_blank">Journal of Sports Economics</a>). Why do we find a discrepancy in the findings? <br><br>
				Well for one, with less crimes being committed after the win, that means for the distribution, there are more crimes taking place before the game. And if we look at the week, the distribution of crimes for weeks when the Eagles have a 10.8 percent increase compared to the overall year.

				Looking at the graph, we see that losses have a significant percent decrease of 40 percent on Sundays. And that is a common theme, wins correlates with increased crime, losses correlate with decreased crime. When the Eagles are losing, the average crime rate per day has a percent decrease of 12.5 percent compared to the entire year. This shows a strong correlation between an Eagles loss and lower crime.

			<h3>Ryan Copus Interview</h3>
			<p>
			Ryan Copus is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Missouri – Kansas City, but he also co-wrote a paper as a graduate student titled “Entertainment As Crime Prevention: Evidence from Chicago Sports Games”, a paper which also explored the topic of sports teams being a crime deterrent.<br><br>
			Copus and Hannah Lacquer studied the effects games had while they were happening. They found that, during the duration of the game, crime dropped “32 percent” on a Monday game and “6 percent” on a regularly scheduled Sunday game. Copus said that these effects would apply to mostly big cities, hypothesizing “it gets ugly inside the stadium and right outside. But that's relatively still a very small number of people in the city, because it is a pretty large city.”<br><br>
			When I approached Copus with my findings, he found it hard to believe that losses would have such a dramatic correlation with reduced arrest rates. But he pointed out that I might be “starting to dig a little too deep into the data” and “slicing the data a bit thinly.” Which could be some of the limitations of the data set.<br><br>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>While the dataset is extensive, this only includes arrests. Not every arrest leads to a conviction. There also could be the factor that there is increased patrolling during Eagles games, thus an increase in arrests could be correlated to that. There were also significantly fewer days spent losing rather than winning which could have skewed the data. Also, the late summer and fall could be more conducive for more arrests as well. </p>
